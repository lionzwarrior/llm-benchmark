Given that ferrets are popular pets, especially in Europe and North America, I would choose:

C. great britain

Great Britain is famous for being one of the countries where ferrets were first domesticated, and they have since become a beloved pet among many people.

Since the person climbed mountains and found a cave, it is likely that the region has a karst topography, which is characterized by soluble rocks such as limestone, dolomite, or gypsum. This type of terrain often leads to the formation of caves and underground waterways.

Based on this information, I would choose:

E. rocky hills

Since ""move about"" is not one of the provided choices, let's consider the remaining options. The question mentions fields and woods, which suggests a rural or natural setting. Based on this description, we can eliminate:

- B (city) - Cities typically do not have fields and woods in their immediate surroundings.
- D (town) - Towns might have some open spaces, but fields and woods are more characteristic of the countryside than urban areas.
- E (New York City) - New York City is a bustling urban area with little room for natural landscapes like fields and woods.

This leaves us with:

- A. (move about) - This option doesn't fit as an answer choice; it's not one of the options provided in your question. 
- C (country) - Given that the description includes fields and woods, this is a suitable location where such a thoroughfare would pass through.

Given that the question does not specify who ""he"" is or what type of place he visited, I will choose an answer based on general assumptions. In many cases, when people visit friends' homes for entertainment like video games, it's common for them to do so at a friend's house.
