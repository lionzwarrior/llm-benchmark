However, I can tell you that anemones are typically found in underwater environments. 

If you would like to proceed with the other options, here's how they relate to anemones:

- B (coral sea): This is a possibility because anemones are often found in coral reefs.
- C (under water): Anemones live in the ocean, so this option makes sense.
- D (flower bed): While some anemones have colorful flowers, this doesn't directly relate to their appearance on window sills.
- E (florida keys): This is a possibility because anemones can be found in Florida Keys coral reefs.

The best answer would likely be the one that most closely matches what you might find on your window sill if it were made of glass or similar material, reflecting light and colors from underwater environments."

If the cave was found in West Virginia or Kentucky, it's likely that the region has a karst topography, which would suggest that the area is composed of rocky hills (E). 

In contrast, deserts (C) and seas (D) would be less likely to have caves, especially ones formed by mountainous terrain. West Virginia and Kentucky are not typically associated with desert geography.
