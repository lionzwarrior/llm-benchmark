If I had to choose an answer based on general knowledge of kindergarten classrooms and typical daily routines, I would suggest:

However, I can provide information on different concepts related to death and afterlife from various cultures and religions.

If you're looking for information on what people who believe in a higher power might think about their afterlife, here are some general concepts:

- Many religious traditions believe in an afterlife where the soul goes to a place of reward or punishment based on their actions during life. For example, in Christianity, the belief is that those who have faith in God will go to heaven.
- Some people believe in an afterlife based on personal achievements or spiritual growth.

 Phoenix is home to Globe Life Field, which opened in 2020.

 Chicago is not among the choices listed for the ""newest"" stadium, however Guaranteed Rate Field has been renovated.

 Antarctica does not have any baseball stadiums as it's uninhabited by humans during most of the year and there isn't a local baseball team. 

 San Francisco home to Oracle Park opened in 2000.

 Urban areas is an option but no new stadium could be pinpointed without more information.";84;132;449471405;916682536

A is incorrect because getting wet has no relation to using a TV.
B is incorrect because opening eyes isn't necessary.
C is incorrect because killing the TV wouldn't be useful.
D is correct in a sense that plugging in was required initially to turn it on, but the question asks what needs to be done ""if"" it's already turned on. In this case, the power cable has been plugged in and the TV is functioning.

So, E implies a step of turning it on initially, which isn't directly relevant here.
