A is incorrect because getting wet has no relation to using a TV,
B is incorrect because opening eyes isn't necessary,
C is incorrect because killing the TV wouldn't be useful,
D is correct in a sense that plugging in was required initially to turn it on, but the question asks what needs to be done ""if"" it's already turned on, In this case, the power cable has been plugged in and the TV is functioning,
