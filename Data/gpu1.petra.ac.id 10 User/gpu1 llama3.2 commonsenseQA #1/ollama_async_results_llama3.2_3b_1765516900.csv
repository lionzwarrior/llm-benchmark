C is also incorrect. While sweat can be caused by intense mental focus, it's unlikely to occur from playing a chess game alone.

D is not the best answer. While tension can certainly build during competitive play, it's too vague of an answer and is likely not what you're looking for.

However, I can give you an explanation for why a young child might struggle to read a long book:

Young children often have difficulty with reading long books because their language skills and reading ability may not be developed enough. Long books typically contain many complex sentences, unfamiliar vocabulary, and dense writing, which can be overwhelming for a child who is still learning to recognize and decode words.
